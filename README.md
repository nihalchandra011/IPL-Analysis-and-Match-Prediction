The <b>Indian Premier League (IPL)</b> is one of the most popular professional Twenty20 cricket leagues in the world, founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The league was started with eight teams and has since expanded to ten teams, with players from all over the world participating in this cash-rich tournament. The league follows a round-robin format, where each team plays the other team twice, once at home and once away. The top four teams in the league stage advance to the playoffs, which include two eliminator matches and a final match to determine the champion. The league has been held annually since its inception, with the 14th season concluded last year in May 2022. The tournament is known for its high-quality cricket, thrilling matches, and star-studded line-up of players. It is a great source of entertainment for cricket fans and also a great opportunity for players to showcase their talent.
